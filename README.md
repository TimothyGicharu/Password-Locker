# Password Locker

A Python script / application that enables a user to save all his / her personal account credentials safely and be able to add, edit or delete them.  
On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.
This is therefore a simple application that will help a user manage their passwords and even generate new passwords for them.
